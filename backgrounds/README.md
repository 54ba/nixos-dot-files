# Background Images

Place your background image here:
- `bg.jpg` - This will be used as the dark mode background

The configuration is set up to use `bg.jpg` as the dark mode wallpaper automatically.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: JPEG or PNG
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher

After adding bg.jpg, run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.
The wallpaper will be available at `/etc/backgrounds/bg-dark.jpg` system-wide.
